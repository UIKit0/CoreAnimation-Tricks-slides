CoreAnimation-Tricks-slides
===========================

The slides from my "Core Animation Tricks" talk at CocoaHeads Stockholm on October 8th 2013.

I've added notes to most of the slides so that you can follow along. It should match roughtly what I said during the presentation.
In general I think that you are better of running the presentation than looking at the slides themselves. I had to do some ugly tricks with many textboxes to get the animations to work as I wanted them to.


Sorry for the file size, there is a number of embedded videos ;)
